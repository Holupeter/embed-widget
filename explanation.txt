Your Convex database already has data in it, likely from previous development. The schema validation error occurs because an existing 'tours' document has a `userId` field that isn't defined in our new schema.

While you can delete data from the Convex dashboard, the recommended and safest approach is to update the schema to accommodate the existing data. This is a common process when evolving an application.

I will add the `userId` field to the `tours` table in `schema.ts`. After that, running `npx convex dev` should succeed.
